The following is the list of changes for Mod_Rexx.

Changes for version 2.4.0
=========================

1. Support for Apache 2.4 64-bit addressing.

2. This release has NOT been tested with Regina Rexx.


Changes for version 2.2.0
=========================

1. Support for Apache 2.2.

2. Fixup for new APR functions and libraries used in Apache 2.2.

3. All support for OS/2 has been removed.

4. This release has NOT been tested with Regina Rexx.

5. Fix the check for Content-Type so that it does not seg fault.


Changes for version 2.1.1
=========================

1. Fixed some minor bugs in some external function which tested for the
   number of arguments incorrectly.

2. Updated copyright statement on all source files to include 2005.

3. Updated makefiles for Open Object Rexx and eliminated IBM Object Rexx.


Changes for version 2.1.0
=========================

1. Fixed the problem of the wrong request record pointer being used in a
   multi-threaded environment. I removed the pointer from the user exit
   userarea which is common to all threads and created a table to hold the
   thread ID and the request record pointer. There is always a one-to-one
   relationship between the thread ID and the request record pointer so it
   makes obtaining the correct request record pointer easy for all the Rexx
   exits.

   The only exception to this coorespondence is when an Object Rexx program
   does IO from an early REPLY method. Since Mod_Rexx is not notified of the
   thread ID of this new thread it will have no entry in the table for the
   thread ID and thus no request record pointer entry. Therefore you can not
   perform HTML page output from early REPLY methods in Object Rexx.

2. Removed the uppercase option argument from the WWWGetArgs function. This
   was confusing to some Rexx programmers. HTML form variables will now be
   used as they appear on the HTML page.

3. Apache 1.3 support has been removed from Mod_Rexx. You should upgrade to
   Apache 2.0.

4. OS/2 is now unsupported by Mod_Rexx. All the OS/2 support code still exists
   in Mod_Rexx but do not expect any support from the Mod_Rexx team. You are
   on your own.

5. The autoconf files have been removed from this release of Mod_Rexx. Full
   support for autoconf will be added in a future release.


Changes for version 2.0.0
=========================

1. Original release for Apache 2.0.
