<title>Available Rexx Variables</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><h1>Available Rexx Variables</h1></center>

<p>The Mod_Rexx interface constructs some Rexx variables
prior to the start of the Rexx program. Others are constructed during a call
to an external Rexx function (these are noted in their descriptions).
Note that if a variable has no valid value then it is assigned a zero-length
string.</p>

<p>The program TEST.REX is a short example of what can be done with the
Mod_Rexx interface.
All available Rexx variables set by the interface start with 'WWW' and are used in
the TEST.REX program.</p>

<br /><table border="1">
<tr><th>Rexx Variable</th><th>Contents</th></tr>

<tr><td>WWWARGS.0</td>
<td>This is the number of arguments passed to the Rexx program by a GET or PUT
HTTP request.
<p>Note: This variable is only valid after a call to the Rexx external function
WWWGetArgs.</p>
</td></tr>

<tr><td>WWWARGS.n.!NAME and <br />WWWARGS.n.!VALUE</td>
<td>This is the list of arguments passed to the Rexx program. If this is a GET
request then this is the list of QUERY_STRING name=value pairs in the URI. If
this is a POST request then this is the list of POST variable name=value pairs.
<p>In addition, the array is also available through Rexx variable indirection i.e.
if WWWARGS.1.!NAME = 'hiddenfield' then WWWARGS.'hiddenfield' = WWWARGS.1.!VALUE.
Note that the case of the variable in the HTML document and the case of the
Rexx variable stem tail are significant.</p>
<p>Note: This variable stem array is only valid after a call to the Rexx external
function WWWGetArgs.</p>
</td></tr>

<tr><td>WWWAUTH_TYPE</td>
<td>This is the authentication method.</td></tr>

<tr><td>WWWCONTENT_LENGTH</td>
<td>This is the length of the data buffer sent by the client.</td></tr>

<tr><td>WWWCONTENT_TYPE</td>
<td>This is content type of the passed data.</td></tr>

<tr><td>WWWCOOKIES.0</td>
<td>This is the number of cookies passed to the Rexx program.
<p>Note: This variable is only valid after a call to the Rexx external function
WWWGetCookies.</p>
</td></tr>

<tr><td>WWWCOOKIES.n.!NAME and <br />WWWCOOKIES.n.!VALUE</td>
<td>This is the list name=value cookie pairs passed to the Rexx program.
<p>In addition, the array is also available through Rexx variable indirection i.e.
if WWWCOOKIES.1.!NAME = 'SESSION_ID' then
WWWCOOKIES.'sessionid' = WWWCOOKIES.1.!VALUE.
Note that the case of the variable in the cookie and the case of the
Rexx variable stem tail are significant.</p>
<p>Note: This variable stem array is only valid after a call to the Rexx external
function WWWGetCookies.</p>
</td></tr>

<tr><td>WWWDEFAULT_TYPE</td>
<td>This is the value of the <i>DefaultType</i> directive or
<b>text/plain</b> if not configured.</td></tr>

<tr><td>WWWFILENAME</td>
<td>This is the fully qualified path and filename which has been translated from
the URI passed to the server.</td></tr>

<tr><td>WWWFNAMETEMPLATE</td>
<td>This is the temporary filename template that will be passed to Mod_Rexx.
It specifies the fully qualified path and filename template
for producing a temporary Rexx file at a specified location. Apache
needs to have write access to the specified file and directory.
<p>The format and rules for the template are the same as for the Rexx external
function SysTempFileName(). See the Rexx Reference manual for more
information.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td>WWWGATEWAY_INTERFACE</td>
<td>This is the name and version of the gateway interface.</td></tr>

<tr><td>WWWHOSTNAME</td>

<tr><td>WWWHTTP_USER_AGENT</td>
<td>This is the browser type and version used by the client.</td></tr>

<tr><td>WWWIS_MAIN_REQUEST</td>
<td><b>1</b> if this is an initial request or for requests triggered by internal
redirects, <b>0</b> for subrequests.
<br /><b>Note:</b> Because of a limitation imposed in the Mod_Rexx package,
the value of this variable will always be <b>1</b>.</td></tr>

<tr><td>WWWPATH_INFO</td>
<td>This is the filename of the script.</td></tr>

<tr><td>WWWPATH_TRANSLATED</td>
<td>This is the fully qualified path and filename of the script.</td></tr>

<tr><td>WWWPOST_STRING</td>
<td>If the WWWREQUESTTYPE is "POST" then this is the unparsed name/value pairs
read from the browser. Otherwise this variable is a zero-length string.
<p>Note: This variable is only valid after a call to the Rexx external
function WWWGetArgs.</p>
</td></tr>

<tr><td>WWWQUERY_STRING</td>
<td>If the WWWREQUESTTYPE is "GET" then this is the unparsed
QUERY_STRING portion of the URI.
Otherwise this variable is a zero-length string.</td></tr>

<p>In addition, you can create additional initialized Rexx variables by using
the <b>RexxSetVar</b> directive in the httpd.conf file.</p>
<p>You can include as many <b>RexxSetVar</b> directives as you need.
They will all be initialized prior to the start of the Rexx script.
Additional information can be found in the
<a href="./RexxDirs.html#RexxSetVar">RexxSetVar</a>
directive documentation.</p>
