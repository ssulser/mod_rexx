<p style="color: red">This version of Mod_Rexx works with Apache 2.4
only. You should carefully read this
documentation before installing or using this version of Mod_Rexx.
It is also highly recommended that if you are using
Open Object Rexx 4.0.0 or any earlier version you should upgrade to version 5.0.0.
There is a bug in prior versions that could cause Apache to crash.</p>

accept the terms of this license to use this software. Refer to
<a href="./CPLv1.0.htm">CPLv1.0.htm</a> for more information.</p>
<p>This package provides an interface from Apache to
Open Object Rexx and Regina Rexx under Windows, AIX and
Linux. To use the package you do not need to know how to write Apache
modules, but you do need a general understanding of how Apache processes
requests.</p>
<p>This package is not an Apache module tutorial/reference.</p>
<p>There are changes in this release of Mod_Rexx which will require some
changes to your Rexx scripts. The builtin function WWWGETARGS has changed
and you will need to adjust your scripts accordingly.</p>

<p>Many people have contributed to this effort and I want to thank some of
them here.</p>

<h2><a name="Whatis">
What is Mod_Rexx</a></h2>
<p>Mod_Rexx is <b>NOT</b> a CGI environment for Rexx. Your Rexx CGI programs
will not run under Mod_Rexx without significant modifications. The Mod_Rexx
execution environment is CGI-like, but even that is not a proper definition
of the environment.</p>
<p>Mod_Rexx is a very powerful package that can bring full control of the
Apache request process to the Rexx programmer. When Apache receives a request
it divides the processing of that request into phases. Each of these phases
is responsible for a small part of the request.</p>
<br />
<center>
<img src="./figure1.jpg" alt="Figure 1" />
</center>
<br />
<ol>
<li>Post Read Request Phase - This phase can modify the request itself after
the request has been read.</li>
<li>URI Translation Phase - This phase maps the URI request to a physical file,
virtual document produced by an external script, or a document generated by
an internal module.</li>
<li>Header Parser Phase - Another chance to examine the request headers.</li>
<li>Access Control Phase - This is the first of three phases that handle
authentication and authorization. This phase should perform simple access
control based on the browser's IP address, hostname, or some other simple
attribute of the programmer's choice.</li>
<li>Authentication Phase - This phase is called whenever the requested file
is password-protected. Usually this phase checks the userid and password.
This is the second phase involved in authentication and authorization.</li>
<li>Authorization Phase - Actually determines if the user is actually
authorized to access the requested URI. This is the third (and last) phase
involved in authentication and authorization.</li>
<li>MIME Type Check Phase - This phase assignes a provisional MIME type to
the request.</li>
<li>Fixup Phase - This is the last chance to modify the request before the
response handler phase is called.</li>
<li>Response Handler Phase - This is also known as the content handler phase.
This phase is responsible for actually returning the requested information
to the browser either dynamically or statically, by returning a file.
This handler acts somewhat like a CGI program but the runtime environment
for this phase is very different from the traditional CGI environment.</li>
<li>Log Phase - This phase is responsible for logging the request.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these phases can have a Rexx script assigned to it. In most cases
you will probably only assign a script to the Response Phase, but it is
possible for a Rexx script to fully process any phase. Mod_Rexx defines
directives which are placed into the Apache configuration file which then
define how a Rexx script is assigned to a particular request phase.</p>
<p>For more information about how the Apache request phases work I highly
recommend the book <cite>Writing Apache Modules with Perl and C</cite> by
Lincoln Stein &amp; Doug MacEachern published by O'Reilly and Asscoiates, Inc.
ISBN: 1-56592-567-X. It should be noted that this book applies to Apache 1.x
only and contains no information on writing modules for Apache 2.0.</p>

<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
<h2><a name="WinInstall">
Windows Package Installation</a></h2>
<p>
To install the package on Windows, unzip the contents to a temporary
subdirectory. Move the following files to these locations (where x: is the
Apache server install drive):</p>
<br />
<pre>
   mod_rexx.dll   ->     x:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Apache2.4\modules

   rspcomp.rex    ->     x:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Apache2.4\bin

   Apache.cls     ->     x:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Apache2.4
                              or
                         somewhere in the system PATH

   test.rex       ->     For testing purposes place all these files in Apache's
   otest1.rex            document root subdirectory. You can move them later.
   footer.rex
   access.rex
   rsptest1.rsp
   rsptest2.rsp
   rsptest3.rsp
</pre>

<p>In the httpd.conf file (located in Apache conf directory) insert the following lines:</p>
<br />
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="90%">
<tr><td valign="top" bgcolor="#e6e6e6">
<pre>
 # The following line needs to be added to the end of the appropriate
 # httpd.conf LoadModule list
 LoadModule rexx_module modules/mod_rexx.dll

 # The following lines should be added at the end of the http.conf file
 #
 AddType application/x-httpd-rexx-script .rex .rexx
 AddType application/x-httpd-rexx-rsp .rsp

 #Add these for Rexx Server Page support
 RexxTempFileNameTemplate "c:/temp/execrsp?????.rex"
 RexxRspCompiler "c:/Program Files/Apache Group/Apache2/bin/rspcomp.rex"
</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>
You may need to modify the lines above if your Apache server modules subdirectory is
not located in the specified place.</p>
<p>
Now restart the Apache server.</p>
<p>
To test that the package is working start your browser and enter the following
URL (where your.domain.com is the name of your server):</p>

<br />
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="90%">
<tr><td valign="top" bgcolor="#e6e6e6">
<pre>
http://your.domain.com/test.rex
</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>
This should execute the Rexx program test.rex and a sample HTML page
should be displayed.</p>
<p>
To build your own Apache Rexx programs just code your program and place it
anywhere in Apache's document tree. Your Rexx programs should have a file
extension which matches one of the extensions listed in the</p>
<pre>
 AddType application/x-httpd-rexx-script .rex .rexx
</pre>
<p>line of the Apache configuration file. When a browser request for a
document arrives at the Apache server it checks the file extension of the
document with its list of handlers and then passes that document to the
appropriate handler. In this case, if the file extension matches, then the
document will be passed to Mod_Rexx and executed as a Rexx program.</p>

<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
<h2><a name="UnixInstall">
Unix Package Installation</a></h2>
<p>
To install the package on Unix, unzip the contents to a temporary subdirectory. Move
the following files to these locations:</p>
<br />
<pre>
   mod_rexx.so    ->     /opt/Apache2.4/modules
                              or
                         /etc/httpd/modules
                              or
                         the modules location of your Apache Server

   rexx.conf      ->     /opt/Apache2.4/conf.d
                              or
                         /etc/httpd/conf.d
                              or
                         the bin location of your Apache Server

   rspcomp.rex    ->     /usr/bin
                              or
                  ->     /opt/Apache2.4/bin
                              or
                         the bin location of your Apache Server

   Apache.cls     ->     /usr/bin
                              or
                         somewhere in the system PATH

   test.rex       ->     For testing purposes place all these files in Apache's
   otest1.rex            document root subdirectory. You can move them later.
   fotter.rex
   access.rex            Note that Rexx program files do NOT need to be marked
   rsptest1.rsp          executable in order for Mod_Rexx to execute them. If
   rsptest2.rsp          you do not mark them executable then they cannot be
   rsptest3.rsp          executed outside of the Mod_Rexx environment by
                         accident or maliciously through the standard Apache
                         CGI interface.
</pre>
<p><b>Note:</b> Be sure to check the install locations against the entries
in the rexx.conf file. The entries in this file may need to be modified
to reflect your install. locations.
<p>
Be sure the mod_rexx.so file is marked executable.</p>
<p>
Now restart the Apache server.</p>
<p>
To test that the package is working start your browser and enter the following
URL (where your.domain.com is the name of your server):</p>

<h2><a name="ProblemInfo">
Known Problems</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>The binary files supplied with this release do not work with versions of
Open Object Rexx or Regina Rexx which do not match the version used during
compilation and linking. You may need to upgrade your version of Rexx or
recompile Mod_Rexx with your version of Rexx before you get a working
mod_rexx binary.</li>
<li>During Apache subrequest processing <b>none</b> of the Rexx handlers
will be invoked. They will always DECLINE the request. This is to prevent
an infinite recursion problem with non-response/content handlers.</li>
<li>Output from the Rexx TRACE instruction will be sent to the
Apache error log. Input to
the TRACE instruction will not be allowed. This limitation has been
imposed due to a problem with Rexx sending error information to the client
browser as an unknown MIME-type when a Rexx program/script crashes.</li>
<li>You should not attempt to do I/O to stdin, stdout or stderr in Rexx
scripts running under Mod_Rexx since they are not attached to traditional
file system or console handles.</li>
<li>Using the Rexx SAY statement or calling the LINEOUT function to stdout from
a Rexx thread (a method that uses the REPLY statement) will cause the Apache
server to ignore the output. This is because Mod_Rexx internally holds the Apache
request record pointer in a table who's key is the Rexx program's main thread ID.
Since the Rexx program's sub thread is unknown to Mod_Rexx there is no entry
in the table for that thread's ID and this will result in the output from the
thread to be ignored.</li>
<li>OS/2 is no longer a supported Mod_Rexx environment.</li>
<li>If you are using Rexx/SQL in combination with Mod_Rexx be sure you are using
the latest version which is thread-safe. Otherwise you will have strange problems
and crashes. Also, on Windows, be sure to define all databases used by Mod_Rexx
via 'SYSTEM DSN'. Databases defined with 'USER DSN' are not available in the
Apache/Mod_Rexx environment.</li>
</ol>

<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
<h2><a name="Future">
Future Enhancements</a></h2>

<li>Add full autoconf support.</li>
